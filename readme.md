# Overview

This is a weekly scheduler app programmed in Swift that allows you to create events and store their related data persistantly. Event names can be colored and will be organized by day. Days can be hidden if you have no desire to add events on a specific day. 

I wanted to create a calendar app that is made specifically for repeating events that contains **right amount** of customization. Many normal calendar apps have far much customization and the UI isn't always as readable. This served as a great oppourtunity to learn to integrate SwiftData and SwiftUI into an app, and further solidify my understanding of the Swift language.

# Development Environment

## IDE
* XCode - Apple's IDE for Swift, Objective-C, and other languages
* GitHub - Publishing files and supplimenting git version control.

## Language and Libraries
* Swift - Apple's high-level development language for programming apps on all their products. 
* SwiftUI - An improvement to the storyboarding Swift used to use. Creates a flexible UI easily
* SwiftData - A library that can be used in place of core data for newer Apple Devices. Makes persistant data easy without custom filewriting and can expand functionality of filewriting for document-based apps

# Future Work

- 12:00 PM and 12 AM don't display properly in Military time
- Sort Events by time
- Add an option to edit events

I also could add widgets to display the current day outside the app.
